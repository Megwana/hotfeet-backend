## User Stories

For my User Stories, I have organised their importance using the MoSCoW method. This is is an acronym which stands for 'must-have', 'should-have' and 'could-have'. This method is helpful tool that I used to help prioritze my product features in this project. If you wish to know more about this method, you read more [here](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/MoSCoW-method).

- Must-Haves = 40%
